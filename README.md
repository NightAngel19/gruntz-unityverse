  Gruntz Unityverse
</h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center">
  An open-source remake of the puzzle game Gruntz, developed with Unity
</h2>

<h2 style="font-weight: bold">
  Coming soon...
</h2>
<p>
  There will be an option to download the current version of the project for playing (basically currently this means testing). These are basically standalone exectuables of the game (just like in case of a completed game), available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: bold">
  The Goal
</h2>
<p>
  One of the main goals of this project is to completely remake Gruntz, for modern systems, with modern solutions. The other one is to enable easy modding, such as adding new Tilesets, Objects, functionality, Game Modes, and whatever you can think of.
</p>

  Contribution
</h2>
<p>
  Anyone is welcome to help! You can contribute to the project in four ways (that I can think of):
  <ol>
    <li>Implementing features, and fixing bugs</li>
    <li>Playing the current version to find bugs</li>
    <li>Coming up with ideas on how to improve and extend the game</li>
    <li>Creating art for Tilesets, EyeCandy, and other Objects</li>
  </ol>
</p>

  Testing
</h2>
<p>
  At the moment, the easiest way to test the current features is to download the <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">Unity Editor</a>, download this project, and hit play in the Editor. I know, it's a bit inconvenient

  There is another similar project currently in development called Dizgruntled, with the same goal, but a different approach. You can find the source for it <a href="https://github.com/Dizgruntled/Dizgruntled">here</a>, or by clicking on the header on top. If you want to play a more developed project, I encourage you to check it out as well, it's really cool. Also, if you just want to play it, you can find it on <a href="https://dizgruntled.com/">https://dizgruntled.com/</a>
